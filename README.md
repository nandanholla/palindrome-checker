# Palindrome Checker

A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.

This application asks a user for a phrase or a word. It checks the user input, runs palindrome check on it, and tells user whether the entered string is a palindrome or not.
